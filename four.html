The company unveiled the new machine at an event at the Flint Center in Cupertino, California, not long after airing a Super Bowl ad directed by Ridley Scott. The Mac wasn't the first computer with a "graphical user interface" that relied on icons rather than command lines. That honor belonged to the Xerox Star. Even so, the Mac influenced the personal computing industry and prompted more intuitive software.</td>

Jobs co-founded NeXT Computer that year. In 1986, he bought animation studio Pixar from Lucasfilm for $5 million. Apple bought NeXT in 1996 for more than $400 million, while Disney paid more than $7 billion to buy Pixar in 2006.</td>

Its colorful, translucent design stunned the tech industry, prompting other computer makers to move away from their standard gray boxes. The iMac was also famous for what it didn't have: A floppy disk drive. Jobs decided the world would move to CDs and Internet downloads and away from disks. It was a controversial move, but he was right.</td>
